### Meat Processing Site

The project involved launching a plant with a capacity of 500 tons of meat products per day. The focus was on integrating domestic technological solutions to reduce reliance on imported equipment. This included designing technical infrastructure, installing Russian machinery, and automating production processes. The plant became a cornerstone of ABI’s strategy to boost production volumes and diversify its product range for both domestic and export markets.

### Semi-Finished and Ready-To-Eat Meals Site

The second facility, also with a 500-ton daily capacity, specialized in frozen products, addressing the rising demand for alternative protein sources. The project required adapting production lines for plant-based raw materials and streamlining logistics and warehousing for the new product line. This plant enabled ABI to enter the fast-growing market of frozen semi-finished and ready-to-eat foods, strengthening its position in Russia and key export regions such as the Middle East.

Together, these plants laid the foundation for ABI’s significant growth and market diversification.
