I have 15+ years of experience driving digital transformation and enhancing supply chains for major food-FMCG companies. I'm an expert at solving complex challenges in uncertain environments.

My projects have won awards like *SAP Value Awards* <sup>[1][1]</sup> <sup>[2][2]</sup> and *Global CIO* <sup>[3][3]</sup>. I've had a few projects up for grabs at some of the main industry events like [Logimat](https://www.logimat-messe.de/en), [CeMAT](https://www.cemat-russia.ru/) and [SAP Forum](https://sap.com). They've been picked as the best in the business.

I manage teams of over 50+ and lead projects with budgets in excess of $130 million. My work covers production and logistics optimisation, business process improvement and IT solutions.
