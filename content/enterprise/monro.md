I was responsible for the operations of the IT department within the Holding, ensuring the SLA for IT services across all business units. I managed internal software development and implementation.
By the end of 2013, the Holding included a variety of facilities such as an automated feed mill, pig farm, poultry farm, meat processing plants, and over 100 retail stores. Key IT projects under my charge included ERP, supply chain forecasting, WMS systems, MES integration, and tax optimization.
