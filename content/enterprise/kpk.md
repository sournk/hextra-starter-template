KPK is meat producer in Siberian region established in 1997. The company produces a wide range of meat products, including over 50 types of sausages and delicacies, and about 30 types of meat semi-finished products. The factory uses high-tech equipment and processes clean chilled meat sourced from its own pig farm. The production process includes natural smoking with beech chips to enhance flavor. The company processes over 1500 tons of products monthly. 

I was responsible for the operations of the IT department within the Holding, ensuring the SLA for IT services across all business units. I managed internal software development and implementation.
By the end of 2013, the Holding included a variety of facilities such as an automated feed mill, pig farm, poultry farm, meat processing plants, and over 100 retail stores. Key IT projects under my charge included ERP, supply chain forecasting, WMS systems, MES integration, and tax optimization.
